# sqtracker

*sqtracker* (or squaretracker, trackerÂ²) is a front-end for BitTorrent trackers such as [opentracker](https://erdgeist.org/arts/software/opentracker/) that adds things like account management and ratio tracking. It's tracking the tracker, hence the name.

This is particularly useful for private tracker communities that want to control who can download, how much they must seed and so on.

As *sqtracker* just sits in front of a BitTorrent tracker, it should theoretically be compatible with any. However opentracker is the most tested and is recommended.
