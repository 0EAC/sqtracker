## Deploying

### Components

An sqtracker deployment is made up of 4 separate components. These are:

#### A MongoDB database

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a popular and powerful document-oriented database. Version 5.2 or higher is required.

#### The sqtracker API service

The sqtracker API service handles all actions taken by users (authentication, uploads, searching etc.), implements the BitTorrent tracker specification to handle announces and scrapes, and provides the RSS feed. 

#### The sqtracker client service

The sqtracker client service provides the modern, responsive web interface that users interact with.

#### A HTTP proxy server

The HTTP proxy allows the client, API, and BitTorrent tracker to all be accessible via a single endpoint.

### Deploying with Docker compose

The sqtracker platform is designed to be deployed via Docker. Once a configuration file is created, deploying is as simple as running `docker compose up -d` at the root of the project.

Alternatively, you can deploy each service individually on a PaaS cloud platform such as [Northflank](https://northflank.com).

If you change the name of any services in `docker-compose.yml`, you will also need to update the relevant host names in your `config.js` and `traefik.yml` files.

## Configuration

All configuration is provided via a single JavaScript file named `config.js`. This file must export an object containing 2 keys: `envs` and `secrets`.

A full list of configuration options is below. All are required.

If your configuration is not valid, sqtracker will fail to start.
